I’m **Dr. Maximiliano S. Beckel**, a postdoctoral researcher at the [Llorens Lab](https://llorenslab.cbm.uam.es/wordpress/), based at the [Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO)](https://www.cbm.uam.es/) in Madrid, Spain. I specialize in **bioinformatics**, **computational biology**, and **data science**, with a strong focus on **transcriptomics** and **single-cell RNA sequencing**.

I earned my PhD in Biological Sciences, where I combined **statistical modeling**, **network theory**, and **molecular biology** to study alternative splicing and gene regulation. More recently, I’ve pursued advanced training in **data mining** and **machine learning**, applying these tools to complex biological datasets.

But my intellectual interests go beyond the lab bench and command line. I also have a background in **philosophy**, and I'm especially drawn to the **philosophy of science**, **epistemology**, and the **social dimensions of scientific knowledge**. I'm interested in how concepts like objectivity, reproducibility, and theory change intersect with everyday scientific practice.

In both my research and teaching, I aim to foster **interdisciplinary thinking** and **critical reflection**—blending computation, biology, and philosophy to deepen our understanding of life and knowledge itself.
