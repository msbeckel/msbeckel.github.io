While early differentiation of adult radial glia-like cells (RGLs) has been studied extensively, the molecular mechanisms guiding the maturation of postmitotic neurons remain unknown. Here, we used a precise birthdating strategy to study aGC differentiation using single-nuclei RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed a continuous trajectory from RGLs to mature aGCs, with multiple immature stages bearing increasing levels of effector genes supporting growth, excitability, and synaptogenesis. Analysis of differential gene expression, pseudo-time trajectory, and transcription factors (TFs) revealed critical transitions defining four cellular states: quiescent RGLs, proliferative progenitors, immature aGCs, and mature aGCs. Becoming mature aGCs involved a transcriptional switch that shuts down pathways promoting cell growth, such SoxC TFs, to activate programs that likely control neuronal homeostasis. aGCs overexpressing Sox4 or Sox11 remained immature. Our results unveil precise molecular mechanisms driving adult RGLs through the pathway of neuronal differentiation."},{"name":"scX: a user-friendly tool for scRNAseq exploration","publisher":"Bioinformatics Advances","releaseDate":"2024","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioadv/vbae062","summary":"In this article, we present scX, an R package built on the Shiny framework that streamlines the analysis, exploration, and visualization of single-cell experiments. With an interactive graphic interface, implemented as a web application, scX provides easy access to key scRNAseq analyses, including marker identification, gene expression profiling, and differential gene expression analysis. Additionally, scX seamlessly integrates with commonly used single-cell Seurat and SingleCellExperiment R objects, resulting in efficient processing and visualization of varied datasets. Overall, scX serves as a valuable and user-friendly tool for effortless exploration and sharing of single-cell data, simplifying some of the complexities inherent in scRNAseq analysis."},{"name":"Conserved and divergent signals in 5’ splice site sequences across fungi, metazoa and plants","publisher":"PLoS Comput Biol","releaseDate":"1916-03-20","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011540","summary":"The main steps of the splicing process are similar across eukaryotes. However, differences in splicing factors, gene architecture, and sequence divergences suggest clade-specific features of splicing and its regulation. Using a regularized maximum entropy modeling approach we investigated two-site statistical patterns to identify conserved and divergent signals embedded in the 5’ splice sites of 30 eukaryotic species. We found that the joint dinucleotide probabilities of donor sequences carry lineage information, and we were able to trace characteristic two-site coupling patterns for plants and animals, which could reflect differences in splicing regulation previously reported between these groups. Our study also extends the observation of negative epistatic signals in mammalian donor sequences. Specifically, we showed that the average strength of coupling parameters between intronic and exonic consensus nucleotides presented destabilizing negative values, which precluded the simultaneous co-occurrence of consensus nucleotides at the intronic and exonic parts of a given donor sequence."}],"skills":[{"name":"Bioinformatics","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Transcriptomics","scRNAseq","Spatial transcriptomics","Variant calling","R","Python"]},{"name":"Data science","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Data wrangling","Machine learning","Deep learning","MLOps","Databases"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Spanish","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Biology","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"references":[{"name":"Professor John Doe","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
