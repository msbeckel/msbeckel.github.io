  abstract={The adult hippocampus generates new granule cells (aGCs) with functional capabilities that convey unique forms of plasticity to the preexisting circuits. While early differentiation of adult radial glia-like cells (RGLs) has been studied extensively, the molecular mechanisms guiding the maturation of postmitotic neurons remain unknown. Here, we used a precise birthdating strategy to study aGC differentiation using single-nuclei RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed a continuous trajectory from RGLs to mature aGCs, with multiple immature stages bearing increasing levels of effector genes supporting growth, excitability, and synaptogenesis. Analysis of differential gene expression, pseudo-time trajectory, and transcription factors (TFs) revealed critical transitions defining four cellular states: quiescent RGLs, proliferative progenitors, immature aGCs, and mature aGCs. Becoming mature aGCs involved a transcriptional switch that shuts down pathways promoting cell growth, such SoxC TFs, to activate programs that likely control neuronal homeostasis. aGCs overexpressing Sox4 or Sox11 remained immature. Our results unveil precise molecular mechanisms driving adult RGLs through the pathway of neuronal differentiation.},

  author={Beckel, Maximiliano S and Kaufman, Bruno and Yanovsky, Marcelo and Chernomoretz, Ariel},
  abstract={The main steps of the splicing process are similar across eukaryotes. However, differences in splicing factors, gene architecture, and sequence divergences suggest clade-specific features of splicing and its regulation. Using a regularized maximum entropy modeling approach we investigated two-site statistical patterns to identify conserved and divergent signals embedded in the 5’ splice sites of 30 eukaryotic species. We found that the joint dinucleotide probabilities of donor sequences carry lineage information, and we were able to trace characteristic two-site coupling patterns for plants and animals, which could reflect differences in splicing regulation previously reported between these groups. Our study also extends the observation of negative epistatic signals in mammalian donor sequences. Specifically, we showed that the average strength of coupling parameters between intronic and exonic consensus nucleotides presented destabilizing negative values, which precluded the simultaneous co-occurrence of consensus nucleotides at the intronic and exonic parts of a given donor sequence.},
